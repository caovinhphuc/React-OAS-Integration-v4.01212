Breakpoint layouts can be provided by the user\nor autogenerated.\n\nRGL is React-only and does not require jQuery.\n\n![BitMEX UI](http://i.imgur.com/oo1NT6c.gif)\n\n> GIF from production usage on [BitMEX.com](https://www.bitmex.com)\n\n[**[Demo](https://react-grid-layout.github.io/react-grid-layout/) | [Changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) | [CodeSandbox Editable demo](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/5ywf7c)**]\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [What's New in v2](#whats-new-in-v2)\n- [Migrating from v1](#migrating-from-v1)\n- [Demos](#demos)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Responsive Usage](#responsive-usage)\n- [Providing Grid Width](#providing-grid-width)\n- [Hooks API](#hooks-api)\n- [API Reference](#api-reference)\n- [Extending: Custom Compactors & Position Strategies](#extending-custom-compactors--position-strategies)\n- [Extras](#extras)\n- [Performance](#performance)\n- [Contribute](#contribute)\n\n## What's New in v2\n\nVersion 2 is a complete TypeScript rewrite with a modernized API:\n\n- **Full TypeScript support** - First-class types, no more `@types/react-grid-layout`\n- **React Hooks** - New `useContainerWidth`, `useGridLayout`, and `useResponsiveLayout` hooks\n- **Composable Configuration** - Group related props into focused interfaces:\n  - `gridConfig` - cols, rowHeight, margin, padding\n  - `dragConfig` - enable, handle, cancel, bounded\n  - `resizeConfig` - enable, handles\n  - `positionStrategy` - transform vs absolute positioning\n  - `compactor` - vertical, horizontal, or custom algorithms\n- **Modular architecture** - Import only what you need:\n  - `react-grid-layout` - React components and hooks (v2 API)\n  - `react-grid-layout/core` - Pure layout algorithms (framework-agnostic)\n  - `react-grid-layout/legacy` - v1 flat props API for migration\n  - `react-grid-layout/extras` - Optional components like `GridBackground`\n- **Smaller bundle** - Tree-shakeable ESM and CJS builds\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\nSee the [RFC](./rfcs/0001-v2-typescript-rewrite.md#breaking-changes-in-v2) for detailed migration examples.\n\n| Change                                                                                                               | Description                                                                                            |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [`width` prop required](./rfcs/0001-v2-typescript-rewrite.md#breaking-changes-in-v2)                                 | Use `useContainerWidth` hook or provide your own measurement                                           |\n| [`onDragStart` threshold](./rfcs/0001-v2-typescript-rewrite.md#1-ondragstart-no-longer-fires-on-click-only-events)   | Now fires after 3px movement, not on mousedown.

You have several options:\n\n### Option 1: useContainerWidth Hook (Recommended)\n\n```tsx\nimport ReactGridLayout, { useContainerWidth } from \"react-grid-layout\";\n\nfunction MyGrid() {\n  const { width, containerRef, mounted } = useContainerWidth();\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={containerRef}>\n      {mounted && <ReactGridLayout width={width}>...</ReactGridLayout>}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Fixed Width\n\n```tsx\n<ReactGridLayout width={1200}>...</ReactGridLayout>\n```\n\n### Option 3: CSS Container Queries or ResizeObserver\n\nUse any width measurement library like [react-sizeme](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-sizeme) or your own ResizeObserver implementation.\n\n### Option 4: Legacy WidthProvider HOC\n\nFor backwards compatibility, you can still use `WidthProvider`:\n\n```tsx\nimport ReactGridLayout, { WidthProvider } from \"react-grid-layout/legacy\";\n\nconst GridLayoutWithWidth = WidthProvider(ReactGridLayout);\n\nfunction MyGrid() {\n  return <GridLayoutWithWidth>...</GridLayoutWithWidth>;\n}\n```\n\n## Hooks API\n\nThe v2 API provides three hooks for different use cases. Choose based on your needs:\n\n| Hook                  | Use When                                                             |\n| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `useContainerWidth`   | You need responsive width measurement (most common)                  |\n| `useGridLayout`       | You're building a custom grid component or need direct state control |\n| `useResponsiveLayout` | You're building a custom responsive grid with breakpoint logic       |\n\n### useContainerWidth\n\nObserves container width using ResizeObserver and provides reactive width updates. This is the recommended way to provide width to the grid.\n\n**Why use it instead of WidthProvider?**\n\n- Hooks are more composable and easier to test\n- No HOC wrapper means simpler component tree\n- Explicit control over when to render (via `mounted`)\n- Works better with SSR\n\n```tsx\nimport { useContainerWidth } from \"react-grid-layout\";\n\nfunction MyGrid() {\n  const { width, containerRef, mounted, measureWidth } = useContainerWidth({\n    measureBeforeMount: false, // Set true for SSR\n    initialWidth: 1280 // Width before first measurement\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={containerRef}>{mounted && <ReactGridLayout width={width} />}</div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Type Definitions:**\n\n```ts\ninterface UseContainerWidthOptions {\n  /** Delay render until width is measured. Useful for SSR. Default: false */\n  measureBeforeMount?: boolean;\n  /** Initial width before measurement. Default: 1280 */\n  initialWidth?: number;\n}\n\ninterface UseContainerWidthResult {\n  /** Current container width in pixels */\n  width: number;\n  /** Whether the container has been measured at least once */\n  mounted: boolean;\n  /** Ref to attach to the container element */\n  containerRef: RefObject<HTMLDivElement | null>;\n  /** Manually trigger a width measurement */\n  measureWidth: () => void;\n}\n```\n\n### useGridLayout\n\nCore layout state management hook. Use this when you need direct control over drag/resize/drop state, or when building a custom grid component.\n\n**Why use it instead of the component?**\n\n- Full control over layout state and updates\n- Access to drag/resize/drop state for custom UIs\n- Can integrate with external state management\n- Build headless grid implementations\n\n```tsx\nimport { useGridLayout, horizontalCompactor } from \"react-grid-layout\";\n\nfunction CustomGrid({ initialLayout }) {\n  const {\n    layout,\n    setLayout,\n    dragState,\n    resizeState,\n    onDragStart,\n    onDrag,\n    onDragStop,\n    onResizeStart,\n    onResize,\n    onResizeStop,\n    containerHeight,\n    isInteracting,\n    compactor\n  } = useGridLayout({\n    layout: initialLayout,\n    cols: 12,\n    compactor: horizontalCompactor, // default is verticalCompactor\n    onLayoutChange: newLayout => console.log(\"Layout changed:\", newLayout)\n  });\n\n  // Access drag state for custom placeholder rendering\n  const placeholder = dragState.activeDrag;\n\n  // Check if any interaction is happening\n  if (isInteracting) {\n    // Disable other UI during drag/resize\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div style={{ height: containerHeight * rowHeight }}>\n      {layout.map(item => (\n        <div\n          key={item.i}\n          onMouseDown={() => onDragStart(item.i, item.x, item.y)}\n        >\n          {item.i}\n        </div>\n      ))}\n      {placeholder && <div className=\"placeholder\" />}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Type Definitions:**\n\n```ts\ninterface UseGridLayoutOptions {\n  /** Initial layout */\n  layout: Layout;\n  /** Number of columns */\n  cols: number;\n  /** Block movement into occupied space instead of pushing items */\n  preventCollision?: boolean;\n  /** Called when layout changes */\n  onLayoutChange?: (layout: Layout) => void;\n  /** Compactor for layout compaction (default: verticalCompactor) */\n  compactor?: Compactor;\n}\n\ninterface UseGridLayoutResult {\n  /** Current layout */\n  layout: Layout;\n  /** Set layout directly */\n  setLayout: (layout: Layout) => void;\n  /** Current drag state (activeDrag, oldDragItem, oldLayout) */\n  dragState: DragState;\n  /** Current resize state (resizing, oldResizeItem, oldLayout) */\n  resizeState: ResizeState;\n  /** Current drop state (droppingDOMNode, droppingPosition) */\n  dropState: DropState;\n  /** Start dragging an item */\n  onDragStart: (itemId: string, x: number, y: number) => LayoutItem | null;\n  /** Update drag position */\n  onDrag: (itemId: string, x: number, y: number) => void;\n  /** Stop dragging */\n  onDragStop: (itemId: string, x: number, y: number) => void;\n  /** Start resizing an item */\n  onResizeStart: (itemId: string) => LayoutItem | null;\n  /** Update resize dimensions */\n  onResize: (\n    itemId: string,\n    w: number,\n    h: number,\n    x?: number,\n    y?: number\n  ) => void;\n  /** Stop resizing */\n  onResizeStop: (itemId: string, w: number, h: number) => void;\n  /** Handle external drag over */\n  onDropDragOver: (\n    droppingItem: LayoutItem,\n    position: DroppingPosition\n  ) => void;\n  /** Handle external drag leave */\n  onDropDragLeave: () => void;\n  /** Complete external drop */\n  onDrop: (droppingItem: LayoutItem) => void;\n  /** Container height in grid rows */\n  containerHeight: number;\n  /** Whether any drag/resize/drop is active */\n  isInteracting: boolean;\n  /** The compactor being used */\n  compactor: Compactor;\n}\n```\n\n### useResponsiveLayout\n\nManages responsive breakpoints and generates layouts for different screen sizes. Use this when building a custom responsive grid.\n\n**Why use it instead of the Responsive component?**\n\n- Direct access to current breakpoint\n- Control over layout generation for new breakpoints\n- Can update layouts for specific breakpoints\n- Build custom breakpoint UIs\n\n```tsx\nimport { useContainerWidth, useResponsiveLayout } from \"react-grid-layout\";\n\nfunction CustomResponsiveGrid() {\n  const { width, containerRef, mounted } = useContainerWidth();\n\n  const {\n    layout, // Current layout for active breakpoint\n    layouts, // All layouts by breakpoint\n    breakpoint, // Current active breakpoint ('lg', 'md', etc.)\n    cols, // Column count for current breakpoint\n    setLayoutForBreakpoint,\n    setLayouts,\n    sortedBreakpoints\n  } = useResponsiveLayout({\n    width,\n    breakpoints: { lg: 1200, md: 996, sm: 768, xs: 480, xxs: 0 },\n    cols: { lg: 12, md: 10, sm: 6, xs: 4, xxs: 2 },\n    layouts: {\n      lg: [{ i: \"1\", x: 0, y: 0, w: 2, h: 2 }],\n      md: [{ i: \"1\", x: 0, y: 0, w: 3, h: 2 }]\n    },\n    // compactor: verticalCompactor (default)\n    onBreakpointChange: (bp, cols) =>\n      console.log(`Now at ${bp} (${cols} cols)`),\n    onLayoutChange: (layout, allLayouts) => saveToServer(allLayouts)\n  });\n\n  // Show current breakpoint in UI\n  return (\n    <div ref={containerRef}>\n      <div>\n        Current breakpoint: {breakpoint} ({cols} columns)\n      </div>\n      {mounted && (\n        <GridLayout width={width} cols={cols} layout={layout}>\n          {/* children */}\n        </GridLayout>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Type Definitions:**\n\n```ts\ninterface UseResponsiveLayoutOptions<B extends string = DefaultBreakpoints> {\n  /** Current container width */\n  width: number;\n  /** Breakpoint definitions (name → min-width).

Use compactors instead: `verticalCompactor.compact(layout, cols)` or get one via `getCompactor('vertical')`.\n\n## Extending: Custom Compactors & Position Strategies\n\n### Creating a Custom Compactor\n\nCompactors control how items are arranged after drag/resize. Create your own for custom layouts like masonry, gravity, or shelf-packing.\n\n**The Compactor Interface:**\n\n```ts\ninterface Compactor {\n  /** Identifies the compaction type */\n  type: \"vertical\" | \"horizontal\" | null | string;\n\n  /**\n   * Whether items can overlap each other.\n   *\n   * When true:\n   * - Items can be placed on top of other items\n   * - Dragging into another item does NOT push it away\n   * - Compaction is skipped after drag/resize\n   *\n   * Use for: layered dashboards, free-form layouts\n   */\n  allowOverlap: boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Whether to block movement that would cause collision.\n   *\n   * When true (and allowOverlap is false):\n   * - Dragging into another item is blocked (item snaps back)\n   * - Other items are NOT pushed away\n   * - Only affects movement, not compaction\n   *\n   * Use with noCompactor for: fixed grids, slot-based layouts\n   *\n   * Note: Has no effect when allowOverlap is true.\n   */\n  preventCollision?: boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Compact the entire layout.\n   * Called after any layout change to fill gaps.\n   *\n   * @param layout - Array of layout items (clone before mutating!)\n   * @param cols - Number of grid columns\n   * @returns New compacted layout\n   */\n  compact(layout: Layout, cols: number): Layout;\n}\n```\n\n**Example: Gravity Compactor (items fall to bottom)**\n\n```ts\nimport { cloneLayout, cloneLayoutItem, getStatics, bottom } from \"react-grid-layout/core\";\n\nconst gravityCompactor: Compactor = {\n  type: \"gravity\",\n  allowOverlap: false,\n\n  compact(layout, cols) {\n    const statics = getStatics(layout);\n    const maxY = 100; // arbitrary max height\n    const out = [];\n\n    // Sort by Y descending (process bottom items first)\n    const sorted = [...layout].sort((a, b) => b.y - a.y);\n\n    for (const item of sorted) {\n      const l = cloneLayoutItem(item);\n\n      if (!l.static) {\n        // Move down as far as possible\n        while (l.y < maxY && !collides(l, statics)) {\n          l.y++;\n        }\n        l.y--; // Back up one\n      }\n\n      out.push(l);\n    }\n\n    return out;\n  }\n};\n\n// Usage\n<GridLayout compactor={gravityCompactor} />\n```\n\n**Example: Single Row Compactor (horizontal shelf)**\n\n```ts\nconst singleRowCompactor: Compactor = {\n  type: \"shelf\",\n  allowOverlap: false,\n\n  compact(layout, cols) {\n    let x = 0;\n    const out = [];\n\n    // Sort by original X position\n    const sorted = [...layout].sort((a, b) => a.x - b.x);\n\n    for (const item of sorted) {\n      const l = cloneLayoutItem(item);\n      if (!l.static) {\n        l.x = x;\n        l.y = 0; // All items on row 0\n        x += l.w;\n\n        // Wrap to next row if overflow\n        if (x > cols) {\n          l.x = 0;\n          x = l.w;\n        }\n      }\n      out.push(l);\n    }\n\n    return out;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Using Helper Functions:**\n\nThe core module exports helpers for building compactors:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  resolveCompactionCollision, // Move items to resolve overlaps\n  compactItemVertical, // Compact one item upward\n  compactItemHorizontal, // Compact one item leftward\n  getFirstCollision, // Find first collision\n  collides, // Check if two items collide\n  getStatics, // Get static items from layout\n  cloneLayout, // Clone layout array\n  cloneLayoutItem // Clone single item\n} from \"react-grid-layout/core\";\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Position Strategy\n\nPosition strategies control how items are positioned via CSS. Create custom strategies for special transform handling.\n\n**The PositionStrategy Interface:**\n\n```ts\ninterface PositionStrategy {\n  /** Type identifier */\n  type: \"transform\" | \"absolute\" | string;\n\n  /** Scale factor for coordinate calculations */\n  scale: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Generate CSS styles for positioning an item.\n   *\n   * @param pos - Position with top, left, width, height in pixels\n   * @returns CSS properties object\n   */\n  calcStyle(pos: Position): React.CSSProperties;\n\n  /**\n   * Calculate drag position from mouse coordinates.\n   * Used during drag to convert screen coords to grid coords.\n   *\n   * @param clientX - Mouse X position\n   * @param clientY - Mouse Y position\n   * @param offsetX - Offset from item left edge\n   * @param offsetY - Offset from item top edge\n   * @returns Calculated left/top position\n   */\n  calcDragPosition(\n    clientX: number,\n    clientY: number,\n    offsetX: number,\n    offsetY: number\n  ): { left: number; top: number };\n}\n```\n\n**Example: Rotated Container Strategy**\n\n```ts\nconst createRotatedStrategy = (angleDegrees: number): PositionStrategy => {\n  const angleRad = (angleDegrees * Math.PI) / 180;\n  const cos = Math.cos(angleRad);\n  const sin = Math.sin(angleRad);\n\n  return {\n    type: \"rotated\",\n    scale: 1,\n\n    calcStyle(pos) {\n      // Apply rotation to position\n      const rotatedX = pos.left * cos - pos.top * sin;\n      const rotatedY = pos.left * sin + pos.top * cos;\n\n      return {\n        transform: `translate(${rotatedX}px, ${rotatedY}px)`,\n        width: `${pos.width}px`,\n        height: `${pos.height}px`,\n        position: \"absolute\"\n      };\n    },\n\n    calcDragPosition(clientX, clientY, offsetX, offsetY) {\n      // Reverse the rotation for drag calculations\n      const x = clientX - offsetX;\n      const y = clientY - offsetY;\n\n      return {\n        left: x * cos + y * sin,\n        top: -x * sin + y * cos\n      };\n    }\n  };\n};\n\n// Usage: grid inside a rotated container\n<div style={{ transform: 'rotate(45deg)' }}>\n  <GridLayout positionStrategy={createRotatedStrategy(45)} />\n</div>\n```\n\n**Example: 3D Perspective Strategy**\n\n```ts\nconst create3DStrategy = (\n  perspective: number,\n  rotateX: number\n): PositionStrategy => ({\n  type: \"3d\",\n  scale: 1,\n\n  calcStyle(pos) {\n    return {\n      transform: `\n        perspective(${perspective}px)\n        rotateX(${rotateX}deg)\n        translate3d(${pos.left}px, ${pos.top}px, 0)\n      `,\n      width: `${pos.width}px`,\n      height: `${pos.height}px`,\n      position: \"absolute\",\n      transformStyle: \"preserve-3d\"\n    };\n  },\n\n  calcDragPosition(clientX, clientY, offsetX, offsetY) {\n    // Adjust for perspective foreshortening\n    const perspectiveFactor = 1 + clientY / perspective;\n    return {\n      left: (clientX - offsetX) / perspectiveFactor,\n      top: (clientY - offsetY) / perspectiveFactor\n    };\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Extras\n\nThe `react-grid-layout/extras` entry point provides optional components that extend react-grid-layout. These are tree-shakeable and won't be included in your bundle unless explicitly imported.\n\n### GridBackground\n\nRenders an SVG grid background that aligns with GridLayout cells. Use this to visualize the grid structure behind your layout.\n\n> Based on [PR #2175](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout/pull/2175) by [@dmj900501](https://github.com/dmj900501).\n\n```tsx\nimport { GridBackground } from \"react-grid-layout/extras\";\nimport ReactGridLayout, { useContainerWidth } from \"react-grid-layout\";\n\nfunction MyGrid() {\n  const { width, containerRef, mounted } = useContainerWidth();\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={containerRef} style={{ position: \"relative\" }}>\n      {mounted && (\n        <>\n          <GridBackground\n            width={width}\n            cols={12}\n            rowHeight={30}\n            margin={[10, 10]}\n            rows={10}\n            color=\"#f0f0f0\"\n            borderRadius={4}\n          />\n          <ReactGridLayout\n            width={width}\n            gridConfig={{ cols: 12, rowHeight: 30, margin: [10, 10] }}\n          >\n            {children}\n          </ReactGridLayout>\n        </>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Props:**\n\n```ts\ninterface GridBackgroundProps {\n  // Required - must match your GridLayout config\n  width: number; // Container width\n  cols: number; // Number of columns\n  rowHeight: number; // Row height in pixels\n\n  // Optional\n  margin?: [number, number]; // Gap between cells (default: [10, 10])\n  containerPadding?: [number, number] | null; // Container padding (default: uses margin)\n  rows?: number | \"auto\"; // Number of rows to display (default: 10)\n  height?: number; // Used when rows=\"auto\" to calculate row count\n  color?: string; // Cell background color (default: \"#e0e0e0\")\n  borderRadius?: number; // Cell border radius (default: 4)\n  className?: string; // Additional CSS class\n  style?: React.CSSProperties; // Additional inline styles\n}\n```\n\n### Fast Compactors\n\nFor large layouts (200+ items), the standard compactors can become slow due to O(n²) collision resolution. The fast compactors use optimized algorithms with O(n log n) complexity.\n\n> Based on the \"rising tide\" algorithm from [PR #2152](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout/pull/2152) by [@morris](https://github.com/morris).\n\n```tsx\nimport {\n  fastVerticalCompactor,\n  fastHorizontalCompactor,\n  fastVerticalOverlapCompactor,\n  fastHorizontalOverlapCompactor\n} from \"react-grid-layout/extras\";\n\n<ReactGridLayout\n  compactor={fastVerticalCompactor}\n  // or compactor={fastHorizontalCompactor}\n  layout={layout}\n  width={width}\n/>;\n```\n\n**Performance Benchmarks:**\n\n| Items | Standard Vertical | Fast Vertical | Speedup |\n| ----- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------- |\n| 50    | 112 µs            | 19 µs         | **6x**  |\n| 100   | 203 µs            | 36 µs         | **6x**  |\n| 200   | 821 µs            | 51 µs         | **16x** |\n| 500   | 5.7 ms            | 129 µs        | **45x** |\n\n| Items | Standard Horizontal | Fast Horizontal | Speedup |\n| ----- | ------------------- | --------------- | ------- |\n| 50    | 164 µs              | 12 µs           | **14x** |\n| 100   | 477 µs              | 25 µs           | **19x** |\n| 200   | 1.1 ms              | 42 µs           | **26x** |\n| 500   | 9.5 ms              | 128 µs          | **74x** |\n\n**Correctness:**\n\nThe fast compactors produce layouts identical to the standard compactors:\n\n- **Vertical**: 0% height difference on deterministic 100-item layouts\n- **Horizontal**: 0% width difference on deterministic 100-item layouts\n- Both pass all correctness tests: no overlaps, idempotent, static item handling\n\n**When to use:**\n\n- Use fast compactors for dashboards with 200+ widgets\n- For smaller layouts (<100 items), standard compactors work equally well\n- Both standard and fast compactors produce valid, non-overlapping layouts\n\n### calcGridCellDimensions (Core Utility)\n\nFor building custom grid overlays or backgrounds, use the `calcGridCellDimensions` utility from `react-grid-layout/core`:\n\n```ts\nimport { calcGridCellDimensions } from \"react-grid-layout/core\";\n\nconst dims = calcGridCellDimensions({\n  width: 1200,\n  cols: 12,\n  rowHeight: 30,\n  margin: [10, 10],\n  containerPadding: [20, 20]\n});\n\n// dims = {\n//   cellWidth: 88.33,  // Width of each cell\n//   cellHeight: 30,     // Height of each cell (= rowHeight)\n//   offsetX: 20,        // Left padding\n//   offsetY: 20,        // Top padding\n//   gapX: 10,           // Horizontal gap between cells\n//   gapY: 10,           // Vertical gap between cells\n//   cols: 12,           // Column count\n//   containerWidth: 1200\n// }\n```\n\nThis is useful for building custom visualizations, snap-to-grid functionality, or integrating with canvas/WebGL renderers.\n\n## Performance\n\n### Memoize Children\n\nThe grid compares children by reference. Memoize them for better performance:\n\n```tsx\nfunction MyGrid({ count, width }) {\n  const children = useMemo(() => {\n    return Array.from({ length: count }, (_, i) => (\n      <div\n        key={i}\n        data-grid={{ x: i % 12, y: Math.floor(i / 12), w: 1, h: 1 }}\n      />\n    ));\n  }, [count]);\n\n  return (\n    <ReactGridLayout width={width} gridConfig={{ cols: 12 }}>\n      {children}\n    </ReactGridLayout>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Avoid Creating Components in Render (Legacy WidthProvider)\n\nIf using the legacy WidthProvider HOC, don't create the component during render:\n\n```tsx\nimport ReactGridLayout, { WidthProvider } from \"react-grid-layout/legacy\";\n\n// Bad - creates new component every render\nfunction MyGrid() {\n  const GridLayoutWithWidth = WidthProvider(ReactGridLayout);\n  return <GridLayoutWithWidth>...</GridLayoutWithWidth>;\n}\n\n// Good - create once outside or with useMemo\nconst GridLayoutWithWidth = WidthProvider(ReactGridLayout);\n\nfunction MyGrid() {\n  return <GridLayoutWithWidth>...</GridLayoutWithWidth>;\n}\n```\n\nWith the v2 API, use `useContainerWidth` hook instead to avoid this issue entirely.\n\n## Custom Child Components\n\nGrid children must forward refs and certain props:\n\n```tsx\nconst CustomItem = forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, CustomItemProps>(\n  (\n    {\n      style,\n      className,\n      onMouseDown,\n      onMouseUp,\n      onTouchEnd,\n      children,\n      ...props\n    },\n    ref\n  ) => {\n    return (\n      <div\n        ref={ref}\n        style={style}\n        className={className}\n        onMouseDown={onMouseDown}\n        onMouseUp={onMouseUp}\n        onTouchEnd={onTouchEnd}\n      >\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you have a feature request, please add it as an issue or make a pull request.\n\nIf you have a bug to report, please reproduce the bug in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/5ywf7c) to help\nus easily isolate it.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"igsys":true,"joost":true,"duchen":true,"rexpan":true,"croogie":true,"fattenap":true,"abuelwafa":true,"devalphac":true,"iceglaive":true,"xiechao06":true,"yangyifan":true,"antoinerev":true,"codevelopit":true,"goulash1971":true,"hal9zillion":true,"malloryerik":true,"shangsinian":true,"markthethomas":true,"daniel-zahariev":true}}
